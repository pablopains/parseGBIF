\title{Check Occurrence Distribution against TDWG Native Range}
\usage{
check_tdwg_distribution(occ = NA, TDWG_LEVEL3 = NULL, wcvp = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{occ}{A data frame containing occurrence data, likely including
geographic coordinates (\code{lat}, \code{lon}), a column with the WCVP taxon
name (\code{wcvp_taxon_name}), and a quality control column like
\code{parseGBIF_dataset_result} (expected to have 'useable' values).}

\item{TDWG_LEVEL3}{An \code{sf} object containing the TDWG Level 3 geographical
boundaries (polygons). If \code{NULL}, it is loaded from
\code{data/tdwg_level3.rds} using \code{here::here()}.}

\item{wcvp}{A list containing the WCVP data, typically the result of
calling a function like \code{wcvp_get_data()}. It should contain at
least the distribution data required by \code{get_tdwg_distribution()}.}
}
\value{
A data frame, which is the result of binding the output of
\code{parse_tdwg_distribution()} for all unique taxa processed. This
data frame typically contains the original occurrence data with
added columns indicating whether the point falls within the
reported native range.
}
\description{
Compares a set of occurrence records with the native geographical distribution,
as defined by the WCVP database and TDWG Level 3 regions.
This function iterates through unique taxa in the occurrence data,
retrieves their native range, and checks which TDWG region each
occurrence point falls into.
}
\details{
The function processes records for each unique taxon, using
\code{get_tdwg_distribution()} to find the known native range and
\code{parse_tdwg_distribution()} to perform the spatial comparison
between the occurrence points and the native regions.
