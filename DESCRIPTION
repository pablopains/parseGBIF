Description: 
    The ParseGBIF workflow is designed to parse duplicate GBIF species occurrence 
    records into unique collection events (gatherings) and to optimise the quality 
    of the spatial data associated with them. ParseGBIF provides tools to verify 
    and standardize species scientific names according to the World Checklist of 
    Vascular Plants taxonomic backbone, and to parse duplicate records into unique 
    'collection events', in the process compiling the most informative spatial data, 
    where more than one duplicate is available, and providing crude estimates of 
    taxonomic and spatial data quality. The package includes functions for data 
    preparation, quality assessment, taxonomic name checking, and visualization 
    through an interactive Shiny application.
